            <ul>
                <li>Name
                    <p>Server name is shown to other Javnce users. The name is just for recognize the different servers from each others.</p>
                </li>
                <li>View access mode
                    <p>When you select this one then users can only see your desktop. Other users cannot not interact with your desktop.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Full access mode
                    <p>When you select this one then users can interact with your desktop, i.e. user have access to your mouse and keyboard and can do what ever you can do.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Auto-connect. 
                    <p>If Auto-connect is not selected then you can either accept or decline users request to connect to your desktop.</p>
                    <p>That is if you select Auto-connect then users can connect to your desktop without your interaction.</p>
                    <p>Note that the accept or decline users request to connect is only "security" feature in Javnce.</p>
